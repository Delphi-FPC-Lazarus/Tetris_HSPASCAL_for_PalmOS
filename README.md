# Tetris_HSPASCAL_for_PalmOS
Game "Senso" written in HSPASCAL for PalmOS on old PALM devices like Palm IIIc, PALM M series and compatible devices. This Code was implemented for an interactive Geocache.

## What it is 
You can use this code to build up your own interactive geocache and publish it on geocaching.com or opencaching.de.
You can use for free, but would be cool if you credit or donate (see below) to original developer YvoPet.

If you need assitance or some old remaining palm hardware, don't hesitate to contact me.
